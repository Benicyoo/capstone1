    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hi, I'm Benicio and I've been studying computer science for 2 years. I really enjoy this major and love learning
         new ways of solving problems and the many different areas of coding. Currently I'm trying to get some 
         experience under my belt by learning Web Development and database systems with the goal of being able to use 
         those skills for handling data and to help me better understand network systems.</p>
    <p>I love understanding how things work so that I can use them in new and creative ways that I enjoy.
        I really feel like my hobbies reflect this interest of mine and if you want to learn more about that
        (and look at my really cool plants) you can visit here: <a href="hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a>
